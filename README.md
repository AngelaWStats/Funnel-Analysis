# Funnel-Analysis

# Project overview

We are working with data from an e-commerce website. The site is very simple and has just 4 pages:

* The ﬁrst page is the home page. When you come to the site for the ﬁrst time, you can only land on the home page as a ﬁrst page.
* From the home page, the user can perform a search and land on the search page.
* From the search page, if the user clicks on a product, she will get to the payment page, where she is asked to provide payment information in order to buy that product.
* If she does decide to buy, she ends up on the conﬁrmation page

Order of funnel:
user page -> home page -> search page -> payment page -> payment confirmation

# Goal 
* Further analyse conversion at each stage of the funnel, in order to identify areas of improvements.
* A full picture of funnel conversion rate for both desktop and mobile
* Some insights on what the product team should focus on in order to improve conversion rate
